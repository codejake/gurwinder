# Read Me

I wanted an easy way to read and re-read Gurwinder's latest Twitter thread, so I converted it to Markdown.

I have left the text largely unchanged, aside from minor typgraphical corrections and the occasional adding of a link for context.

I have an extremely limited amount of time to work on this, but I hope to post more Twitter threads here.

## Threads
- March 17, 2023 - 40 Mind-Expanding Concepts You Should Know [Markdown](2023-03-17.markdown), [PDF](2023-03-17.pdf)


## TODO

- Set up an automation to convert Markdown to PDF/EPUB/etc, and include those exported files in this report, to make it easier for non-programmers and lazy people to digest.
- Convert more Twitter threads to Markdown and post them here.
