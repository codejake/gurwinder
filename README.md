# Read Me

I wanted an easy way to read and re-read Gurwinder's latest Twitter thread, so I converted it to Markdown.

I have an extremely limited amount of time to work on this, but I hope to post more Twitter threads here.

## TODO

- Set up an automation to convert Markdown to PDF, EPUB, and whatever else makes it easier for non-programmers and lazy people to digest.
- Convert more Twitter threads to Markdown and post them here.
